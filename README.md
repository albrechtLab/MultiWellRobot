Recommended steps for independent/modular robot automation:

1. Visit Arduino Create to upload RobotController_2018.ino script to Arduino(1):
https://create.arduino.cc/editor/rosslagoy/33ba4f04-3064-49b6-8265-8dfdec810b8c
2. Use MATLAB to control the robotic system with ROBOT_2018.m
3. Or, use serial communication with RobotController_2018.ino through Arduino Create.

Recommended steps for integrated robot with microscopy automation:

1. Visit Arduino Create to upload the Arduino scripts to each respective controller:
